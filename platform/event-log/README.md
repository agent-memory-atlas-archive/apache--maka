# maka-event-log

[简体中文](README.zh-CN.md)

Owns the SQLite event store and State Root lease. It persists application sources and packages, operation receipts, sessions, turns and recovery records. Start with `root` for exclusive ownership, `applications` for committed compositions, and `recovery` for interrupted work. Opening a Root establishes the durable owner before services activate; plugins keep their own policy while this crate records canonical facts.

Original operation contracts are stored once by digest. Operation requests and receipt references carry that identity, so journal reads, caller history and UI delivery do not repeatedly copy service schemas. Reads verify the exact original request fingerprint; admission still validates the complete contract and resource requirements.
